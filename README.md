.gitignore on branches properly
vs code is nice using git

___________________________________________________________

conlcusion :

a progect has a master / main file
you work on the main file 
you do all work on main file 

once basic structure is formed you push to online rep

you make newer moddification on working directory
you stage and commit
you push

branches are made when everything is working

version controll

make atomic commits 

use switch to change branches
use revert to go to commit
use checkout to revert to file in commit

use diff

use HEAD and checkout to navigate structure tree
